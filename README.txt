Greetings!

I'm Dylan Diener, and this is my second project for CSCI 1302. This program
works with object arrays as well as introduces concepts of polymorphism amongst
other things. Essentially, most of my class files contain code for different objects 
all bound together by an abstract class. This way, they can all be put into an 
array and different sorts of actions can be done to the array and each
data member! THe Main.java file gives users a menu to choose from and each key
that the user presses does a different action. 

Pressing 1 shows how many objects there are.
Pressing 2 shows the name and each kind of vehicle.
Pressing 3 shows only the vehicles that can fly.
Pressing 4 shows onlu the vehicles that can float.
Pressing 5 shows ony the vehciles that can both float and fly.
6 gives a breif description of all vehicels.
pressing h opens a help screen.
pressing q ends the program.

The progam accounts for all invalid input so feel free to play with it! 

Enjoy!
